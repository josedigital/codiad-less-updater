codiad-less-updates
===================

a very specific script for my workflow on Chromebook. it transfers a css file from server where codiad resides to the server hosting the web site.

when a .less file is compiled with the Less Compiler Plugin for Codiad, the genereated css file will be sent to the specified directory in accept/index.php

update.php should reside in the same workspace directory the .less file is in.
